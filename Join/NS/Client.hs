Module     : Join.NS.Client
Copyright  : (c) Samuel A. Yallop, 2014
Maintainer : syallop@gmail.com
Stability  : experimental

Defines a simple client to the nameserver defined at 'Join.NS.Server'.

A Client is responsible for handling interactions with a single nameserver.


E.G. given:

@
callbacks = Callbacks
  {_callbackMsgFor       = \cname msg -> putStrLn $ show cname ++ " sent: " ++ show msg
  ,_callbackServerQuit   = putStrLn \"ServerQuit\"
  ,_callbackUnregistered = \cname cnames -> putStrLn $ "Unregistered: " ++ show (cname:cnames)
  }

...

-- Client 1
main = do
  client1 <- runNewClient "127.0.0.1" 5555 callbacks
  isRegistered <- register client1 "name1"
  nameExists   <- query client1 "name2"
  if isRegistered && nameExists
    then msgTo client1 "name2" "hello"
    else return ()

...

-- Client 2
main = do
  client2 <- runNewClient "127.0.0.1" 5555 callbacks
  isRegistered <- register client2 "name2"
  nameExists   <- query client2 "name1"

  if isRegistered && nameExists
    then msgTo client2 "name1" "world"
    else return ()
@

If Join.NS.Server is ran on 127.0.0.1 with './NS 5555'.
then if client1 and client2 are compiled and ran, also at 127.0.0.1:
then the output will be:

@
 Client1: name1 sent "world"
 Client2: name2 sent "hello"
@
